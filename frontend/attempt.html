                <p class="scenario">
                    In large cities, people rely on on-demand transport for daily commuting and deliveries. The core challenge is not booking a ride, but trusting the system in real time knowing where the vehicle is, when it will arrive, and whether the system reacts correctly to delays, cancellations, or traffic changes.
                    To solve this, a real-time transport platform is introduced. Users request a ride or delivery, are matched with a nearby driver, and track the journey live on a map. The experience must feel instant, predictable, and calm, even though the system underneath is constantly changing.
                    The platform must manage live location updates, ETA recalculation, cancellations, and UI responsiveness, without overwhelming the user or exposing system complexity.

                            When a user opens the app, the first screen immediately shows a map view. A single input field allows the user to enter a destination. The bottom section displays ride options, estimated prices, and time to arrival. Navigation is minimal, with only essential tabs accessible without leaving the map view.
                            This structure must allow the user to complete the entire booking flow with *very few taps*, while keeping the map visible at all times.

                        Once a ride is confirmed, the user sees a vehicle icon moving smoothly on the map. The estimated arrival time updates automatically without refreshing the screen. If traffic conditions change, the ETA adjusts gradually instead of jumping suddenly.
                        The system must continuously receive location updates and reflect them visually without breaking animations or freezing the interface, even on slow networks.

                        The ride progresses through multiple states: requested, driver assigned, arriving, in progress, completed. Each state unlocks or disables certain actions (cancel, contact driver, share trip).
                        If the driver cancels or goes offline, the system must instantly reassign another driver without forcing the user to restart the process. All transitions must feel natural and predictable.

                        The interface uses a dark or muted map background to reduce eye strain. Primary actions (confirm ride, cancel, share) use high-contrast solid colors. Secondary information is shown using lighter text and subtle animations.
                        Buttons are large, rounded, and placed within thumb-reach. No unnecessary icons, gradients, or decorative elements are used. The design must remain readable while the user is moving.

            <p class="scenario">
                In large cities, people rely on on-demand transport for daily commuting and deliveries. The core challenge is not booking a ride, but trusting the system in real time knowing where the vehicle is, when it will arrive, and whether the system reacts correctly to delays, cancellations, or traffic changes.
                To solve this, a real-time transport platform is introduced. Users request a ride or delivery, are matched with a nearby driver, and track the journey live on a map. The experience must feel instant, predictable, and calm, even though the system underneath is constantly changing.
                The platform must manage live location updates, ETA recalculation, cancellations, and UI responsiveness, without overwhelming the user or exposing system complexity.

            <p class="scenario">
                In large cities, people rely on on-demand transport for daily commuting and deliveries. The core challenge is not booking a ride, but trusting the system in real time knowing where the vehicle is, when it will arrive, and whether the system reacts correctly to delays, cancellations, or traffic changes.
                To solve this, a real-time transport platform is introduced. Users request a ride or delivery, are matched with a nearby driver, and track the journey live on a map. The experience must feel instant, predictable, and calm, even though the system underneath is constantly changing.
                The platform must manage live location updates, ETA recalculation, cancellations, and UI responsiveness, without overwhelming the user or exposing system complexity.

                <p class="scenario">
                        When a user opens the app, the first screen immediately shows a map view. A single input field allows the user to enter a destination. The bottom section displays ride options, estimated prices, and time to arrival. Navigation is minimal, with only essential tabs accessible without leaving the map view.
                        This structure must allow the user to complete the entire booking flow with **very few taps**, while keeping the map visible at all times.

                <p class="scenario">
                    Once a ride is confirmed, the user sees a vehicle icon moving smoothly on the map. The estimated arrival time updates automatically without refreshing the screen. If traffic conditions change, the ETA adjusts gradually instead of jumping suddenly.
                    The system must continuously receive location updates and reflect them visually without breaking animations or freezing the interface, even on slow networks.

                <p class="scenario">
                    The ride progresses through multiple states: requested, driver assigned, arriving, in progress, completed. Each state unlocks or disables certain actions (cancel, contact driver, share trip).
                    If the driver cancels or goes offline, the system must instantly reassign another driver without forcing the user to restart the process. All transitions must feel natural and predictable.

                    The interface uses a dark or muted map background to reduce eye strain. Primary actions (confirm ride, cancel, share) use high-contrast solid colors. Secondary information is shown using lighter text and subtle animations.
                    Buttons are large, rounded, and placed within thumb-reach. No unnecessary icons, gradients, or decorative elements are used. The design must remain readable while the user is moving.

            <p class="scenario">
                In large cities, people rely on on-demand transport for daily commuting and deliveries. The core challenge is not booking a ride, but trusting the system in real time knowing where the vehicle is, when it will arrive, and whether the system reacts correctly to delays, cancellations, or traffic changes.
                To solve this, a real-time transport platform is introduced. Users request a ride or delivery, are matched with a nearby driver, and track the journey live on a map. The experience must feel instant, predictable, and calm, even though the system underneath is constantly changing.
                The platform must manage live location updates, ETA recalculation, cancellations, and UI responsiveness, without overwhelming the user or exposing system complexity.

                <p class="scenario">
                        When a user opens the app, the first screen immediately shows a map view. A single input field allows the user to enter a destination. The bottom section displays ride options, estimated prices, and time to arrival. Navigation is minimal, with only essential tabs accessible without leaving the map view.
                        This structure must allow the user to complete the entire booking flow with **very few taps**, while keeping the map visible at all times.

                <p class="scenario">
                    Once a ride is confirmed, the user sees a vehicle icon moving smoothly on the map. The estimated arrival time updates automatically without refreshing the screen. If traffic conditions change, the ETA adjusts gradually instead of jumping suddenly.
                    The system must continuously receive location updates and reflect them visually without breaking animations or freezing the interface, even on slow networks.

                <p class="scenario">
                    The ride progresses through multiple states: requested, driver assigned, arriving, in progress, completed. Each state unlocks or disables certain actions (cancel, contact driver, share trip).
                    If the driver cancels or goes offline, the system must instantly reassign another driver without forcing the user to restart the process. All transitions must feel natural and predictable.

                    The interface uses a dark or muted map background to reduce eye strain. Primary actions (confirm ride, cancel, share) use high-contrast solid colors. Secondary information is shown using lighter text and subtle animations.
                    Buttons are large, rounded, and placed within thumb-reach. No unnecessary icons, gradients, or decorative elements are used. The design must remain readable while the user is moving.

            <p class="scenario">
                In large cities, people rely on on-demand transport for daily commuting and deliveries. The core challenge is not booking a ride, but trusting the system in real time knowing where the vehicle is, when it will arrive, and whether the system reacts correctly to delays, cancellations, or traffic changes.
                To solve this, a real-time transport platform is introduced. Users request a ride or delivery, are matched with a nearby driver, and track the journey live on a map. The experience must feel instant, predictable, and calm, even though the system underneath is constantly changing.
                The platform must manage live location updates, ETA recalculation, cancellations, and UI responsiveness, without overwhelming the user or exposing system complexity.

            <p class="scenario">
                In large cities, people rely on on-demand transport for daily commuting and deliveries. The core challenge is not booking a ride, but trusting the system in real time knowing where the vehicle is, when it will arrive, and whether the system reacts correctly to delays, cancellations, or traffic changes.
                To solve this, a real-time transport platform is introduced. Users request a ride or delivery, are matched with a nearby driver, and track the journey live on a map. The experience must feel instant, predictable, and calm, even though the system underneath is constantly changing.
                The platform must manage live location updates, ETA recalculation, cancellations, and UI responsiveness, without overwhelming the user or exposing system complexity.

                <p class="scenario">
                        When a user opens the app, the first screen immediately shows a map view. A single input field allows the user to enter a destination. The bottom section displays ride options, estimated prices, and time to arrival. Navigation is minimal, with only essential tabs accessible without leaving the map view.
                        This structure must allow the user to complete the entire booking flow with **very few taps**, while keeping the map visible at all times.

                <p class="scenario">
                    Once a ride is confirmed, the user sees a vehicle icon moving smoothly on the map. The estimated arrival time updates automatically without refreshing the screen. If traffic conditions change, the ETA adjusts gradually instead of jumping suddenly.
                    The system must continuously receive location updates and reflect them visually without breaking animations or freezing the interface, even on slow networks.

                <p class="scenario">
                    The ride progresses through multiple states: requested, driver assigned, arriving, in progress, completed. Each state unlocks or disables certain actions (cancel, contact driver, share trip).
                    If the driver cancels or goes offline, the system must instantly reassign another driver without forcing the user to restart the process. All transitions must feel natural and predictable.

                    The interface uses a dark or muted map background to reduce eye strain. Primary actions (confirm ride, cancel, share) use high-contrast solid colors. Secondary information is shown using lighter text and subtle animations.
                    Buttons are large, rounded, and placed within thumb-reach. No unnecessary icons, gradients, or decorative elements are used. The design must remain readable while the user is moving.

            <p class="scenario">
                In large cities, people rely on on-demand transport for daily commuting and deliveries. The core challenge is not booking a ride, but trusting the system in real time knowing where the vehicle is, when it will arrive, and whether the system reacts correctly to delays, cancellations, or traffic changes.
                To solve this, a real-time transport platform is introduced. Users request a ride or delivery, are matched with a nearby driver, and track the journey live on a map. The experience must feel instant, predictable, and calm, even though the system underneath is constantly changing.
                The platform must manage live location updates, ETA recalculation, cancellations, and UI responsiveness, without overwhelming the user or exposing system complexity.

                <p class="scenario">
                        When a user opens the app, the first screen immediately shows a map view. A single input field allows the user to enter a destination. The bottom section displays ride options, estimated prices, and time to arrival. Navigation is minimal, with only essential tabs accessible without leaving the map view.
                        This structure must allow the user to complete the entire booking flow with **very few taps**, while keeping the map visible at all times.

                <p class="scenario">
                    Once a ride is confirmed, the user sees a vehicle icon moving smoothly on the map. The estimated arrival time updates automatically without refreshing the screen. If traffic conditions change, the ETA adjusts gradually instead of jumping suddenly.
                    The system must continuously receive location updates and reflect them visually without breaking animations or freezing the interface, even on slow networks.

                <p class="scenario">
                    The ride progresses through multiple states: requested, driver assigned, arriving, in progress, completed. Each state unlocks or disables certain actions (cancel, contact driver, share trip).
                    If the driver cancels or goes offline, the system must instantly reassign another driver without forcing the user to restart the process. All transitions must feel natural and predictable.

                    The interface uses a dark or muted map background to reduce eye strain. Primary actions (confirm ride, cancel, share) use high-contrast solid colors. Secondary information is shown using lighter text and subtle animations.
                    Buttons are large, rounded, and placed within thumb-reach. No unnecessary icons, gradients, or decorative elements are used. The design must remain readable while the user is moving.
